            <p>
                Hi! I'm Andrei, project engineer extraordinaire with over 7 years of experience in the mechanical and industrial engineering fields. <br>
                I have successfully designed mass-produced injection-molded components as well as made-to-order ASME vessels.<br>
                <br>
                I have graduated with honors from the reputable University of California, Irvine with a Masters in Aerospace Engineering specializing in Fluid-Dynamics. <br>
                I especially enjoyed the classes with a heavy focus on programming. Some of my favorite projects were simulating a fluid flow and watching a computer generate the results, or programming a microcontroller to react to external input.<br>
                <br>
                In my free time I enjoy biking, snowboarding, reading the latest Sci-Fi books, building and flying drones, and learning open-source software and other programming languages.<br>
                <br>
                You are welcome to explore my website and please feel free to contact me if I can be of service.
            </p>
